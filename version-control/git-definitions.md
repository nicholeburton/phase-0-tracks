# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a collection of changes made to a repository which allows for reviewing, reverting, and / or merging. It is useful because it provides a safety net for exploration as well as mistakes, enables multiple people to work on a single project at the same time. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is effectiely a line of development independent from any others. Branches enable an individual or set of individuals to work on a repo without effecting the master branch, which gives one room to polish their work before peer-reviewed and merged.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit effectively a save point in a given repository. A good commit message describes in explicit terms what was changed and where the change was made. They must be unambigious and clear as not to confuse any other collaborators.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occours when two or more individuals have made changes to the exact same part of a given file, and because git is unable to know which change to use, it asks the user to take a look.
