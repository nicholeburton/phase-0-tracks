Run a SQL query for each of the following:

Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

solo_project :> sqlite3 company.db
SQLite version 3.8.10.2 2015-05-20 18:17:19
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> SELECT * FROM employees;
1|Magic Johnson|Designer|true|1
2|Grace Boogers|UI Designer|true|2
3|Rachel Unicorn|Javascript Specialist|true|3
4|Michelle Visage|SQL Guardian|true|4
5|Rachel Ray|People Manager|true|5
6|Michael Bay|Project Manager|true|6
sqlite>

Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> UPDATE employees SET name = "Beyonce" WHERE employee_id = 1;

Display the information in both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT * FROM employees JOIN teams ON employees.team_id = teams.team_id;
1|Beyonce|Designer|true|1|1|Branding|1
2|Grace Boogers|UI Designer|true|2|2|UI Design|1
3|Rachel Unicorn|Javascript Specialist|true|3|3|Front End|2
4|Michelle Visage|SQL Guardian|true|4|4|Back End|2
5|Rachel Ray|People Manager|true|5|5|People Managers|3
6|Michael Bay|Project Manager|true|6|6|Project Managers|3

Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT employees.name, employees.role, teams.team_name FROM employees JOIN teams ON employees.team_id = teams.team_id;
Beyonce|Designer|Branding
Grace Boogers|UI Designer|UI Design
Rachel Unicorn|Javascript Specialist|Front End
Michelle Visage|SQL Guardian|Back End
Rachel Ray|People Manager|People Managers
Michael Bay|Project Manager|Project Managers

Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = "Michael Bay";

Try a few different joins in your database

SELECT employees.name, teams.team_name FROM employees INNER JOIN teams ON employees.team_id = teams.team_id;
Beyonce|Branding
Grace Boogers|UI Design
Rachel Unicorn|Front End
Michelle Visage|Back End
Rachel Ray|People Managers
