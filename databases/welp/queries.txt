You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM users AS us iNNER JOIN reviews as rev ON us.user_id = rev.user_id INNER JOIN businesses bu ON rev.business_id = bu.business_id;
1|Bradford|Pitt|1|5|Best wedding ever!|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
2|Mandy|Kaling|2|3|There weren't any strobe lights.|2|2|2|Amir's Towing
4|Steven|Wonder|3|4|Feeling like a renewed yogi.|4|4|4|Lotus Yoga

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT first_name, last_name, stars, comment FROM users AS us iNNER JOIN reviews as rev ON us.user_id = rev.user_id INNER JOIN businesses bu ON rev.business_id = bu.business_id;
Bradford|Pitt|5|Best wedding ever!
Mandy|Kaling|3|There weren't any strobe lights.
Steven|Wonder|4|Feeling like a renewed yogi.

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM users AS us iNNER JOIN reviews as rev ON us.user_id = rev.user_id INNER JOIN businesses bu ON rev.business_id = bu.business_id WHERE bu.business_id = 1;
